## LDTS_11_05 - PACMAN

In this project, we developed a pacman clone written in Java with the GUI Framework "Lanterna". In it, you control pacman through different arenas collecting all the PacDots and PowerPellets you can while being chased by 4 different enemy characters.

This game was developed by Tomás Pinto Macedo (up202108811@fe.up.pt), Davide Pinto Teixeira (up202109860@fe.up.pt) and Emanuel Rui Tavano Maia (up202107486@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2022⁄23.
